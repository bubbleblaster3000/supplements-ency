      "overview": "Creatine monohydrate is an amino acid derivative naturally produced in the body from glycine, arginine, and methionine. It is stored primarily in skeletal muscle as phosphocreatine, where it plays a critical role in the rapid regeneration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) during high-intensity, short-duration activities. Supplementation increases intramuscular creatine stores by 20–40%, enhancing the phosphocreatine energy system. Beyond its well-established ergogenic effects, emerging evidence supports cognitive benefits, particularly under conditions of sleep deprivation or mental fatigue. Creatine is one of the single most studied supplements in sports nutrition, with a robust safety profile confirmed across hundreds of trials.",
      "mechanismOfAction": "Creatine is phosphorylated by creatine kinase to form phosphocreatine (PCr) in muscle tissue. During high-intensity exercise, PCr donates its phosphate group to ADP to rapidly regenerate ATP, the primary cellular energy currency. This replenishment of ATP allows for sustained maximal effort during short bursts of activity (e.g., sprinting, heavy lifting). In the brain, creatine similarly supports ATP regeneration in neurons, which may underlie its cognitive benefits. Additionally, creatine may enhance cellular hydration (cell volumization), activate mTOR signaling pathways involved in muscle protein synthesis, and reduce myostatin expression.",

      "overview": "Lion's Mane (Hericium erinaceus) is an edible medicinal mushroom that has been used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine for centuries. What distinguishes Lion's Mane from other nootropics is its unique ability to stimulate the synthesis of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) — proteins essential for neuronal growth, survival, and synaptic plasticity. The bioactive compounds responsible — hericenones (found in the fruiting body) and erinacines (found in the mycelium) — can cross the blood-brain barrier and directly promote neurogenesis. While the body of human clinical evidence is still growing, preclinical data is robust and early human trials are promising for cognitive enhancement, mood improvement, and neuroprotection.",
      "mechanismOfAction": "Lion's Mane contains two families of bioactive compounds with distinct neurotrophic mechanisms: hericenones (from the fruiting body) and erinacines (from the mycelium). Erinacines are small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier and stimulate NGF synthesis in astrocytes via activation of the JNK pathway. NGF promotes the growth, maintenance, and survival of neurons, and is critical for cholinergic system function (acetylcholine-producing neurons involved in memory and learning). Hericenones also stimulate NGF but through different signaling pathways. Additionally, Lion's Mane exhibits anti-inflammatory effects in the CNS by reducing NF-κB-mediated neuroinflammation, and has demonstrated promotion of myelination (the insulating sheath around nerve fibers), which improves nerve signal conduction speed.",

Unlike immediate-release amphetamine formulations, lisdexamfetamine is pharmacologically inactive until enzymatically cleaved in the bloodstream by red blood cell-associated enzymes, which convert it into l-lysine and active d-amphetamine. This prodrug design provides a smoother, longer-lasting pharmacokinetic profile (10–14 hours of therapeutic effect), reduced abuse potential compared to other amphetamines, and less pronounced peak-and-trough fluctuations. It is approved for the treatment of ADHD in children (≥6 years), adolescents, and adults, as well as moderate-to-severe binge eating disorder (BED) in adults. Elvanse is classified as a Schedule II controlled substance due to its amphetamine component.",
      "mechanismOfAction": "After oral administration, lisdexamfetamine is absorbed in the GI tract and hydrolyzed in red blood cells by the enzyme aminopeptidase, releasing active d-amphetamine. D-amphetamine exerts its therapeutic effects primarily through two mechanisms: (1) It promotes the release of dopamine and norepinephrine from presynaptic nerve terminals into the synaptic cleft by reversing the direction of dopamine (DAT) and norepinephrine (NET) transporters. (2) It inhibits the reuptake of these catecholamines by blocking DAT and NET. Additionally, at higher concentrations, amphetamines inhibit vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), increasing cytoplasmic catecholamine availability, and weakly inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO). The net effect is a significant increase in dopaminergic and noradrenergic signaling in the prefrontal cortex (improving executive function and attention) and subcortical reward circuits.",

While originally developed and approved for major depressive disorder, it is now far more commonly prescribed off-label at low doses (25–150 mg) for insomnia — making it one of the most prescribed sleep medications worldwide. Unlike benzodiazepines and Z-drugs, trazodone is not a controlled substance, carries no meaningful abuse potential, does not suppress slow-wave or REM sleep, and may actually improve sleep architecture. At higher doses (150–600 mg), it retains antidepressant efficacy through serotonergic mechanisms.

At low doses (25–100 mg, used for insomnia): it acts primarily as a potent antagonist at 5-HT₂A serotonin receptors and H₁ histamine receptors, both of which promote sedation and sleep initiation. It also blocks α₁-adrenergic receptors, contributing to its sedative and hypotensive effects. At higher doses (150–600 mg, antidepressant range): serotonin reuptake inhibition (SRI) becomes more prominent, increasing serotonergic tone in the synapse — the classical antidepressant mechanism. Importantly, trazodone does not significantly affect GABAergic neurotransmission (unlike benzodiazepines), which is why it lacks abuse potential and does not cause tolerance, dependence, or rebound insomnia.

L-DOPA is then decarboxylated to dopamine, which can be further converted to norepinephrine by dopamine β-hydroxylase, and then to epinephrine by phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase. Under normal resting conditions, tyrosine hydroxylase is not substrate-limited — meaning extra tyrosine doesn't significantly increase catecholamine production. However, during stress (physiological or psychological), catecholamine turnover increases dramatically, and TH approaches substrate saturation. In this depleted state, supplemental tyrosine provides additional substrate to maintain neurotransmitter synthesis. Tyrosine crosses the blood-brain barrier via the large neutral amino acid transporter (LAT1) — absorption is improved when taken on an empty stomach to avoid competition with other amino acids.",

(3) Glutamate modulation: NAC modulates the cystine-glutamate antiporter (system xc−), increasing extracellular glutamate in the nucleus accumbens, which activates inhibitory metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR2/3). This reduces excitatory neurotransmission and may underlie its benefits in OCD, addiction, and compulsive disorders. (4) Anti-inflammatory effects: NAC inhibits NF-κB activation and reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β).

K2 activates osteocalcin (which deposits calcium into bone matrix) and matrix GLA protein (which prevents arterial calcification). Vitamin D deficiency is a global pandemic — an estimated 1 billion people worldwide have insufficient levels (<30 ng/mL), and many experts argue that optimal levels (40–60 ng/mL) require supplementation for most people, especially those living above 35° latitude, working indoors, or with darker skin.

(2) Immune modulation: enhances innate immunity (cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide production) while modulating adaptive immunity (reducing excessive Th1/Th17 responses, promoting Treg cells). (3) Muscle function: VDR activation in muscle cells supports contractile function. Vitamin K2 (MK-7) activates two critical calcium-regulatory proteins via gamma-carboxylation: osteocalcin (directs calcium to bones) and matrix GLA protein (MGP, prevents calcium deposition in arterial walls).

Pharmacologically, Huperzine A is a highly selective, reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) — the enzyme that breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. By inhibiting AChE, Huperzine A increases synaptic acetylcholine concentrations, enhancing cholinergic neurotransmission critical for memory, learning, and attention. Unlike pharmaceutical AChE inhibitors (e.g., donepezil, rivastigmine), Huperzine A has a more favorable side-effect profile and additional neuroprotective mechanisms including NMDA receptor antagonism, antioxidant activity, and protection against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. It has been studied in China for Alzheimer's disease treatment and is used globally as a nootropic for cognitive enhancement. Its long half-life (~10–14 hours) allows for once-daily dosing.",
      "mechanismOfAction": "Huperzine A exerts its cognitive-enhancing effects primarily through potent, reversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). It binds to the active site of AChE with higher affinity and longer duration than many pharmaceutical inhibitors, effectively increasing acetylcholine (ACh) availability in the synaptic cleft. This enhanced cholinergic transmission supports memory encoding, attention, and learning — processes heavily dependent on ACh signaling in the hippocampus and cortex. Beyond AChE inhibition, Huperzine A has several secondary neuroprotective mechanisms: (1) NMDA receptor antagonism — it acts as a non-competitive antagonist at the NMDA glutamate receptor, protecting neurons against excitotoxic damage from excessive glutamate signaling. (2) Antioxidant activity — Huperzine A scavenges free radicals and reduces oxidative stress in neuronal tissue. (3) Mitochondrial protection — it helps maintain mitochondrial membrane potential and reduces apoptotic signaling in neurons exposed to toxic insults.

Modern research has revealed berberine to be one of the most pharmacologically potent natural compounds available, with robust evidence for blood glucose reduction, lipid lowering, and metabolic syndrome management. Head-to-head trials have shown berberine to be comparable to metformin in reducing fasting blood glucose and HbA1c in type 2 diabetic patients.

Activated AMPK stimulates glucose uptake (via GLUT4 translocation), enhances fatty acid oxidation, inhibits lipogenesis, and promotes mitochondrial biogenesis. (2) Insulin signaling — Berberine upregulates insulin receptor (InsR) expression and improves insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) phosphorylation, enhancing cellular insulin sensitivity independently of AMPK. (3) Gut microbiome modulation — Berberine significantly reshapes the gut microbiota composition, increasing short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria and reducing endotoxin-producing species, contributing to improved metabolic markers and reduced intestinal inflammation. (4) PCSK9 inhibition — Berberine downregulates proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) expression in the liver, increasing LDL receptor recycling and reducing circulating LDL cholesterol.

Endogenous CoQ10 synthesis peaks around age 20–25 and declines progressively thereafter, with levels in the heart muscle dropping by approximately 50% by age 70. This decline is implicated in age-related mitochondrial dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, and decreased exercise capacity. Statin medications further deplete CoQ10 by inhibiting the mevalonate pathway (shared with cholesterol synthesis), making supplementation particularly important for statin users.",
      "mechanismOfAction": "CoQ10 functions at the intersection of energy metabolism and antioxidant defense: (1) Electron Transport Chain — CoQ10 (as ubiquinone) accepts electrons from NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I) and succinate dehydrogenase (Complex II) and transfers them to cytochrome bc1 (Complex III) in the mitochondrial inner membrane. This electron shuttling is essential for maintaining the proton gradient that drives ATP synthase (Complex V). Without adequate CoQ10, oxidative phosphorylation slows, and ATP production drops. (2) Antioxidant defense — In its reduced form (ubiquinol), CoQ10 is one of the only endogenously synthesized lipid-soluble antioxidants. It neutralizes lipid peroxyl radicals in cell membranes and LDL particles, preventing chain reactions of lipid peroxidation. It also regenerates the active forms of vitamin E (α-tocopherol) and vitamin C, making it a linchpin in the antioxidant network. (3) Anti-inflammatory — CoQ10 reduces NF-κB-mediated inflammatory signaling and has been shown to decrease circulating levels of IL-6 and TNF-α. (4) Endothelial function — CoQ10 improves nitric oxide bioavailability and endothelial function, contributing to its cardiovascular benefits.",

      "overview": "Digestive enzymes are catalytic proteins that break down macronutrients into absorbable units: proteases cleave proteins into amino acids and peptides, lipases hydrolyze fats into fatty acids and glycerol, and amylases convert starches into simple sugars. The human body produces these enzymes endogenously — primarily in the pancreas, stomach, and small intestinal brush border — but production can be suboptimal due to aging (pancreatic enzyme output declines ~1% per year after age 30), chronic stress (which diverts blood flow away from the GI tract), food intolerances, pancreatic insufficiency, or simply the sheer volume and composition of large, protein-dense meals common in athletic diets. Supplemental digestive enzyme complexes like the GN Digestive Enzymes provide exogenous protease, lipase, amylase, and often additional specialty enzymes (lactase, cellulase, bromelain, papain) to augment the body's own digestive capacity. For athletes consuming 150–250+ g protein per day across multiple large meals, enzyme supplementation can meaningfully improve protein utilization, reduce bloating and GI distress, and ensure that expensive supplements and carefully planned meals are actually being fully absorbed.",
      "mechanismOfAction": "Digestive enzyme supplements work by directly augmenting the enzymatic pool in the gastrointestinal tract: (1) Proteases (including bromelain, papain, and pancreatin-derived proteases) — hydrolyze peptide bonds in dietary proteins, accelerating the breakdown of intact protein into di-/tripeptides and free amino acids that can be absorbed via PepT1 and amino acid transporters in the small intestine. This is particularly relevant for large protein boluses (40–60 g per meal) where endogenous protease capacity may become rate-limiting. (2) Lipases — hydrolyze triglycerides at the sn-1 and sn-3 positions, releasing free fatty acids and 2-monoacylglycerol for absorption. This complements pancreatic lipase and is crucial for fat-soluble vitamin absorption (D3, K2, CoQ10). (3) Amylases — cleave α-1,4-glycosidic bonds in starch, producing maltose, maltotriose, and α-limit dextrins for subsequent hydrolysis by brush-border enzymes. (4) Specialty enzymes: lactase (hydrolyzes lactose for those with lactose intolerance), cellulase (breaks down plant cell walls to release nutrients from vegetables), and alpha-galactosidase (breaks down raffinose/stachyose in legumes that cause gas).

      "overview": "Glycine is the smallest and simplest amino acid, yet it plays disproportionately critical roles across multiple physiological systems. It is a conditionally essential amino acid — while the body can synthesize it, endogenous production (~3 g/day) falls significantly short of total metabolic demand (~10–15 g/day), creating a chronic shortfall that worsens with age. Glycine is required for: (1) glutathione synthesis — it is one of the three amino acid building blocks of glutathione (γ-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine), the body's master antioxidant; (2) collagen synthesis — glycine constitutes approximately one-third of all amino acid residues in collagen, the most abundant protein in the body; (3) creatine synthesis — glycine is one of three precursors to creatine; (4) heme and porphyrin synthesis; (5) bile salt conjugation; and (6) neurotransmission — glycine acts as both an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brainstem and spinal cord (via glycine receptors) and a co-agonist at NMDA receptors. Most remarkably, 3 g of glycine taken before bed has been shown in human trials to improve sleep quality through a unique thermoregulatory mechanism — reducing core body temperature by promoting peripheral vasodilation.",
      "mechanismOfAction": "Glycine's diverse effects stem from its roles in multiple biochemical pathways: (1) Sleep promotion — Glycine activates NMDA receptors in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the brain's master circadian clock, which triggers a downstream signaling cascade that promotes peripheral vasodilation (increased blood flow to hands and feet). This causes heat dissipation from the body's core, reducing core body temperature — a critical physiological trigger for sleep onset. This mechanism is distinct from GABAergic sedation and explains why glycine improves sleep quality without causing grogginess. (2) Glutathione synthesis — Glycine is the final amino acid added to the γ-glutamylcysteine dipeptide by glutathione synthetase. When glycine is supplemented alongside NAC (the GlyNAC protocol), glutathione repletion is maximized because both the rate-limiting substrate (cysteine from NAC) and the final substrate (glycine) are supplied in abundance. (3) Collagen support — As every third residue in the collagen triple helix is glycine (the Gly-X-Y repeating motif), glycine availability is directly rate-limiting for collagen synthesis in connective tissue, skin, joints, and bone. (4) Inhibitory neurotransmission — Glycine acts at strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors in the brainstem and spinal cord, producing inhibitory (calming) neurotransmission, muscle relaxation, and anti-spastic effects. (5) Anti-inflammatory — Glycine activates glycine-gated chloride channels on immune cells (Kupffer cells, macrophages, neutrophils), reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine release (TNF-α, IL-6).",

      "overview": "Myo-inositol is the most abundant stereoisomer of inositol, a cyclohexane polyol once classified as Vitamin B8 (though it is no longer considered a vitamin since the body can synthesize it). Despite endogenous production, supplementation at gram-level doses has demonstrated significant clinical effects across multiple domains. Myo-inositol is a critical component of the phosphatidylinositol (PI) signaling system — one of the most important intracellular second messenger pathways. It is required for the function of serotonin (5-HT₂), dopamine, and insulin receptors, all of which use PI-derived second messengers (IP₃ and DAG) for signal transduction. This explains its broad therapeutic profile: at doses of 12–18 g/day, myo-inositol has demonstrated efficacy comparable to SSRIs for panic disorder and OCD in head-to-head trials. At lower doses (2–4 g), it calms anxious rumination and improves sleep onset. It is also a first-line treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), where it improves insulin sensitivity, restores ovulatory function, and reduces hyperandrogenism. Myo-inositol has a remarkably benign side-effect profile, making it an attractive option for conditions typically treated with pharmaceuticals.",
      "mechanismOfAction": "Myo-inositol's effects are mediated through its role as a precursor to phosphatidylinositol (PI) and its phosphorylated derivatives (PIP, PIP₂, PIP₃) — components of one of the most important intracellular signaling cascades: (1) Serotonin signaling — 5-HT₂A and 5-HT₂C receptors are Gq-coupled receptors that signal through phospholipase C (PLC), which cleaves PIP₂ into IP₃ (inositol triphosphate) and DAG (diacylglycerol). IP₃ triggers intracellular calcium release from the ER, while DAG activates PKC. By increasing the pool of myo-inositol → more PI → more PIP₂, inositol supplementation enhances the sensitivity and signaling capacity of serotonergic neurotransmission. This is likely the mechanism behind its anxiolytic, anti-OCD, and anti-panic effects. (2) Insulin signaling — Inositol phosphoglycans (IPGs) act as second messengers downstream of the insulin receptor. Myo-inositol and its epimer D-chiro-inositol (DCI) enhance insulin signal transduction, improve GLUT4 translocation, and increase glucose disposal — explaining its efficacy in PCOS and insulin resistance. (3) Osmoregulation — Inositol acts as an organic osmolyte in the brain, kidney, and other tissues, protecting cells against osmotic stress. (4) Sleep — The enhancement of serotonergic signaling, combined with GABAergic modulation, likely underlies myo-inositol's ability to reduce anxious pre-sleep rumination and facilitate sleep onset.",

      "overview": "Taurine is the most abundant free amino acid in the human body (found in concentrations of 50–75 g total), heavily concentrated in excitable tissues — the brain, retina, heart, skeletal muscle, and immune cells. Chemically, it is an amino sulfonic acid (not a true amino acid, as it has a sulfonic acid group rather than a carboxyl group and is not incorporated into proteins). Despite its abundance, taurine is classified as conditionally essential because endogenous synthesis (from cysteine via cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase) may be insufficient under conditions of stress, illness, aging, and high physical demands. Taurine's physiological roles are extraordinarily broad: it stabilizes cell membranes, regulates calcium signaling, functions as an osmolyte, conjugates bile acids for fat digestion, acts as an antioxidant, and modulates neurotransmission via GABA-A and glycine receptors. A landmark 2023 Science paper demonstrated that taurine supplementation extended median lifespan by 10–12% in mice and improved multiple aging hallmarks, generating enormous scientific interest. In exercise physiology, taurine improves endurance performance, reduces oxidative damage, and enhances recovery. For sleep, its GABAergic and glycinergic properties promote relaxation and sleep quality.",
      "mechanismOfAction": "Taurine acts through multiple mechanisms across different tissues: (1) Neurotransmission — Taurine is a partial agonist at GABA-A receptors and an agonist at glycine receptors in the brain and spinal cord, producing inhibitory (calming) neurotransmission. This dual inhibitory action underlies its anxiolytic and sleep-promoting effects. It also modulates glutamate signaling, providing neuroprotection against excitotoxicity. (2) Calcium homeostasis — Taurine regulates intracellular calcium levels by modulating calcium channel activity and sarcoplasmic reticulum function. In the heart, this stabilizes cardiac rhythm and contractility. In skeletal muscle, it optimizes excitation-contraction coupling. (3) Osmoregulation — Taurine acts as a major organic osmolyte, protecting cells against volume changes under osmotic stress. This is critical in the brain (preventing cerebral edema) and kidneys. (4) Antioxidant defense — While not a direct free radical scavenger, taurine stabilizes mitochondrial electron transport, reduces electron leakage and ROS generation at the source, and maintains glutathione levels. Taurine chloramine (formed when taurine reacts with HOCl in neutrophils) has anti-inflammatory properties. (5) Bile acid conjugation — Taurine conjugates with bile acids (taurocholate, taurochenodeoxycholate) in the liver, essential for dietary fat emulsification and absorption. (6) Anti-aging — The 2023 Science paper showed taurine declines with age in mice, monkeys, and humans, and supplementation reversed multiple aging hallmarks: reduced DNA damage, telomere attrition, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, and chronic inflammation.",

It is one of the most extensively researched natural compounds in biomedical science, with over 15,000 published studies examining its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-cancer, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective properties. Curcumin's therapeutic breadth stems from its ability to modulate over 100 distinct molecular targets, though its master mechanism is potent inhibition of NF-κB — the transcription factor that acts as a central switch for inflammatory gene expression. The central challenge with curcumin is its notoriously poor bioavailability: native curcumin has ~1% oral absorption due to rapid hepatic metabolism (glucuronidation and sulfation) and poor aqueous solubility. This has driven the development of enhanced-absorption formulations — piperine (black pepper extract) inhibits glucuronidation and increases curcumin bioavailability by ~2,000%, while newer technologies (phytosomes, nanoparticles, micelles) achieve even greater improvements. When bioavailability is addressed, curcumin demonstrates clinically meaningful anti-inflammatory effects rivaling NSAIDs in some contexts, without the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks.",

Since NF-κB controls the expression of >500 genes involved in inflammation, immunity, and cell survival, this single mechanism has cascading downstream effects: reduced production of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, COX-2, iNOS, MMP-9, and other pro-inflammatory mediators. (2) COX-2 / LOX inhibition — Curcumin directly inhibits cyclooxygenase-2 and 5-lipoxygenase, reducing prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis (similar to NSAIDs, but without gastric toxicity). (3) Nrf2 activation — Curcumin activates the Nrf2-ARE pathway, upregulating phase II detoxification enzymes and endogenous antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, heme oxygenase-1). (4) STAT3 / AP-1 inhibition — Curcumin inhibits additional pro-inflammatory transcription factors, broadening its anti-inflammatory coverage. (5) Epigenetic modulation — Curcumin modulates histone acetyltransferases (HATs), histone deacetylases (HDACs), and DNA methyltransferases, influencing gene expression at the epigenetic level.

      "tagline": "The body's endogenous circadian rhythm regulator — most effective at low, physiological doses as a sleep-onset phase-setter rather than a sedative.",
      "overview": "Melatonin is an endogenous hormone produced primarily by the pineal gland in response to darkness, serving as the master signal that synchronizes the circadian clock with the light-dark cycle. It is not a sedative in the traditional sense — rather, it acts as a chronobiotic (circadian phase-shifter) that tells the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) 'it is now nighttime,' facilitating the cascade of physiological changes that enable sleep onset: core body temperature reduction, cortisol suppression, parasympathetic nervous system activation, and drowsiness. Exogenous melatonin supplementation is one of the most widely used sleep aids worldwide, yet it is also one of the most commonly misunderstood and misused. The critical insight is that melatonin's primary mechanism is circadian signaling, not sedation — and it is most effective at low, physiological doses (0.3–1 mg) that mimic normal endogenous production, rather than the supraphysiological doses (3–10 mg) found in most commercial products. Higher doses do not improve sleep proportionally and may cause next-day grogginess, vivid dreams, and paradoxical wakefulness. Beyond sleep, melatonin is a potent antioxidant with emerging evidence for immune modulation, neuroprotection, and anti-aging properties — melatonin levels decline dramatically with age, and this decline may contribute to age-related sleep disruption and increased disease susceptibility.",
      "mechanismOfAction": "Melatonin exerts its effects through both receptor-dependent and receptor-independent mechanisms: (1) MT1 and MT2 receptors — Melatonin binds to two G-protein-coupled receptors in the SCN and other tissues. MT1 receptor activation promotes sleepiness by inhibiting SCN neuronal firing (reducing the circadian alerting signal). MT2 receptor activation shifts the phase of the circadian clock — this is the mechanism behind melatonin's ability to advance or delay sleep timing (chronobiotic effect). These receptors are also found in the retina, cardiovascular system, immune cells, and reproductive organs, explaining melatonin's systemic effects. (2) Antioxidant activity — Melatonin is a direct free radical scavenger with unique properties: it detoxifies hydroxyl radicals (•OH), peroxynitrite (ONOO⁻), singlet oxygen, and other ROS. Unlike most antioxidants, melatonin's metabolites (AFMK, AMK) are also antioxidants, creating an 'antioxidant cascade' where a single melatonin molecule can neutralize up to 10 ROS. Melatonin also stimulates the expression of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GPx, GR) via Nrf2 activation. (3) Immune modulation — Melatonin enhances both innate and adaptive immunity, stimulates natural killer cell activity, modulates T-cell function, and has anti-inflammatory properties (NF-κB inhibition). (4) Mitochondrial protection — Melatonin accumulates in mitochondria at concentrations many times higher than in plasma, protecting the electron transport chain from oxidative damage and maintaining membrane potential. (5) Core body temperature — Melatonin promotes heat dissipation (vasodilation of distal skin areas), supporting the decline in core body temperature needed for sleep onset.",

        "notes": "Less is more with melatonin — this is perhaps the supplement where the dose-response relationship is most counterintuitive. Supraphysiological doses (5–10 mg) can desensitize MT1/MT2 receptors, cause next-day grogginess, produce vivid/disturbing dreams, and paradoxically worsen sleep quality in some individuals. The physiological nighttime peak of endogenous melatonin produces blood levels equivalent to approximately 0.3 mg of oral melatonin. Most commercial products are vastly overdosed.

Unlike amphetamines, methylphenidate does not significantly promote the release of dopamine from vesicular stores — it is a pure reuptake inhibitor. The therapeutic effects in ADHD result from enhanced dopaminergic signaling in the prefrontal cortex (improving executive function, working memory, and sustained attention) and in the striatum (modulating reward processing and behavioral inhibition). At therapeutic doses, PET studies show methylphenidate occupies approximately 50–75% of DAT, with clinical response correlating to this occupancy range.

In children and adolescents, methylphenidate is often preferred as the initial trial medication in European guidelines; amphetamines are preferred first-line in US guidelines. Approximately 70% of patients respond to methylphenidate. Those who do not may respond to amphetamines (and vice versa). Methylphenidate's shorter duration of action can be advantageous for patients who experience significant insomnia on longer-acting stimulants. Not recommended during pregnancy. Caution in patients with anxiety disorders, tic disorders, or seizure history (lowers seizure threshold slightly).",
